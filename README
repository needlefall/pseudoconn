### Overview ###

Thank you for accepting the Pindrop Tooling Team coding challenge! 

The PseudoConn project in this repository is a framework for creating both sides
(ie, client and server) of network traffic. Abstraction closely follows the
typical network stack. All payloads are generated in pure Ruby; no additional
dependencies are used to create Ethernet frames and PCAP files.

The /samples/ directory holds working examples of the framework in action. A
tool such as Wireshark can be used to verify the output of this framework.

### Technical Challenge ###

Fork this repository and either:
A.) implement support for a protocol of your choice, or
B.) extend a protocol already implemented in this framework

Please compose a corresponding example in /samples/ to demonstrate its use. We
will use a recent version of Wireshark to view the output of your example, so
be sure to pick a protocol and/or feature set that Wireshark supports.

We don't want you to spend more than a couple hours on this exercise, so please
implement as much or as little as you think is necessary to highlight your
abilities.

***Submit your work as a Pull Request from your fork back to this repository.***

Please include documentation in your Pull Request detailing what you chose to
implement.
